# Week 01

## Day 1 (July 5)

What is one thing you’re proud of learning or building today?

I am proud that of building this website from scratch. I love that I have stopped to as questions along the way. I feel like I have found a way to study that helps it click. I am excited for what is next and am proud of my interest and dedication today.

## Day 2 (July 6)

In your own words, describe one concept that really clicked for you today. What made it make sense — was it a visual analogy, coding it yourself, or something else?

Wrappers: I learned to think of them as ziplock baggies for a project. For example, if I was trying to arrange content on a poster board, I might use a wrapper ‘ziploc bag’ to arrange the sections in the way I want them to sit without being interrupted by the rest of the project content.

## Day 3 (July 8)

**July 8th Reflection:**

What’s one thing that felt confusing at first today but now makes more sense? And how will you apply that understanding tomorrow as you keep building?

I was confused by the JS structure but now it makes sense to think about what I want it to do… I wanted this to run only after the toggle has been triggered.”

## Day 4 (July 9)

What do I now understand about how data flows through React components?

React flows downward from parent to child. I understand now that when importing data, it's important to import that data at the top of the structure to feed into the array or data model.

## Day 5 (July 10)
What was the most confusing part of this lesson, and what helped you finally start to understand it?
The most confusing part of this lesson was breaking down keys, maps, and props. Especially in terms of syntax, naming conventions, and their different purposes. For example in this line of code:
[const renderNameTag = (name) => <NameTag name={name.person} key={name.id} />;]
I have a better understanding of what’s happening here. We are calling a function, renderNameTag, to render the UI element of NameTag with the name of the person based on the dataset of objects that include a name and ID number. name is a prop. name is an object.
