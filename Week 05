## Day 28 (Aug 4)
Its been a full 10 days since my last commit. My last dat at my job was July 30th. I spent the next few days relaxing 
and preparin gmentally for this next push. Admittedly, I have been nervous. I have been procrastinating. Today was my
first real day back in the swing of things. I started a new repo to practice react fundamentals as I finish up my react lessons in Skillcrush.
It will probably take me another half a day to get through this but then I start my SkillCrush react project and
FINALLY move into learning Python. yay!

## Day 29 (Aug 5)
Didn't have much time today to devote to this. Tomorrow will better. Focused on functional components and syntax.
