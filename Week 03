## Day 14 (July 21)
Closing out my portfolio building sprint with my 3rd project - a real dashboard for Baltimoreans to locate mental health resources by program type, accesibility, and audience. 
I'm tired. I'm still motivated. I'm proud. 

## Day 16 (July 23)
Today I solved a real layout challenge by switching the orientation of my accessibility chart. The x-axis labels weren't rendering. 
Which is apparently a common bug. I really want to focus on accessibility and making sure all the data is as transparent as possible. 
I played around with a few different fixes at first, some more destructive than others and ultimately landed on the simplest solution. 
I love how versatile debugging is. The more I practice and the more I grow, the more I will be able to find the most efficient path from problem A to point B. 
After coming from a social media manager role, this kind of logic and efficiency excites me. 

## Day 18 (July 25)
Okay, I took a full week (and some change) off from Skillcrush to get my portfolio together, and honestly, I don’t regret it at all. I built three real projects! I rewrote all my README.mds to actually reflect who I am, and shipped a site I’m proud of. I also started applying to jobs and officially have a public presence as a developer.
Now that that sprint is over, I can feel it’s time to circle back. I used a lot of AI support while building, and now I want to actually understand what I wrote.
So:
- I’m starting with my portfolio site and walking through every line of HTML, CSS, and JS
- I’m going to rebuild little pieces from scratch
- I’m easing back into Skillcrush
- And I’ll start applying to 3–5 solid jobs a day. 
Feeling motivated. A little nervous. But mostly clear-headed.
