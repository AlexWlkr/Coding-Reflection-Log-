## Day 44
It has been a few weeks. I have primarily focused on packing up my home and moving to a new one with my fiance. I am excited to get back into a solid groove again with coding. 
I am sprucing up my portfolio and starting the JavaScript30 challenge. I completed the drumkit tutorial and it was a great refresher on ES6 syntax.
