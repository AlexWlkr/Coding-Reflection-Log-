💡 About This Repo -
This is my personal coding journal as I transition into full-stack development. I'm using this space to document what I learn, reflect on my progress, and stay consistent with my goals. Most days I’ll share summaries, notes, and small code experiments from what I’m learning.

Whether you're a future employer or another beginner: welcome! 🎉
