# Week 02

## Day 8 (July 14)
I studied lifecyle methods today and stateful componenets again. I feel a little more confortable and am glad I hung in there. 

How much of this project did you understand while writing it, and how much are you understanding better after seeing it run or breaking it down?
After studying lifecycle methods, I had the idea to create a quick site to countdown until my last work day to celebrate y freedom from my past a career adn my transition into studying full stack, full time until I can get a job (and then beyond, of course).
I really liked learning with the help of AI for this quick project. It helped me test what I rememberedf ormearlier HTML and CSS lessons. It helped me mentally separate vanilly ajs from react in my head. It was nice to do something like this. It was interesting to see a "simple project" quickly become more complicated, experiment with debugging and explore the infinite potenial of css. Ultimately, I would love to be able to do this for myself, from the ground up. For the first time, I caught a little fire in my chest, feeling really good about eh direciton I'm going. The feeling of trying something new and loving it, not just studying it. Looking forward to the future. Wait for me guys!

## Day 9 (July 16)
For the next few days, I am going to focus on my portfolio website. I need to be ready to apply to jobs soon. I like focusing on this project.

## Day 10 (July 17)
Today I learned to tread carefully when copying and pasting code between similar sections—those small differences can really trip you up! I was also reminded how crucial correct syntax and spelling are when linking CSS to HTML. 7/10 times, if something didn’t work the way I expected, it turned out to be a tiny issue like an extra space or a rogue “s” in my stylesheet. Attention to detail matters.
